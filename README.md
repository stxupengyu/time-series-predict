# time-series-predict
Using Holt-Winters, ARIMA and SARIMA model to predict the electricity consumption.  
I have monthly electricity consumption data from 2000 to 2007, and I want to predict the next 20 years' electricity consumption.  
we use three model to achieve the goals, and finally I write three models' results to predict.csv  
Most of the comments are added by the author are in Chinese. For English readers, please ignore the chinese comments or translate them.  
For the convenience of presentation, in addition to the .R file, I also provide the .Rmd file.
